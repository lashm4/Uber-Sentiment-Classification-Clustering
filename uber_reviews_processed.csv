Uber shuttle Driver did not stop at the location and despite calling him there was no response. Firstly the bus was late and then he drives past without stopping or even picking the call. Understand that you are offering a promotional free ride but doesn't count if the service is not serving the purpose. I wasted 30 min and had to make expensive travel arrangement to reach on time for another meeting. Poor service from Uber.
